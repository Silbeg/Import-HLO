//Version 1.0

What this script does (or should do correctly): 
	Level 
	Class 
	Deity
	XP
	Background
	Alignment
	Hero Points
	Focus Points
	Ability Scores and modifiers
	Skills and Lore
	Saving Throws
	Class Feats

What this script does partially:
	Ancestry and Heritage - Some heritages do not export correctly from HLO. This does not seem to be heritage specific as I have has Twilight Halfling export on one character but not another. If your heritage is not exported, this field is filled with just your ancestry (i.e. Halfling). 
	Hit Points - The export contains your maximum and current HP, but does not break down how much comes from your ancestry and class. Nor does it have any bonuses like the Toughness feat. You will have to add those manually to the sheet. 
	General and Skill Feats - The export contains all of your feats, but has no way to differentiate if you took it as a skill feat or a general feat. I've imported them all into general and if you want to move them, feel free. 
	Ancestry Feats - One of my test character export files did not contact any Heritage feats at all. You may have to add these by drag-and-drop.
	
What this script does not do yet (To do list):
	Gear
	Weapon attacks
	Armor Class
	Spell Attack and DC rolls
	Actions or Abilities on the character tab
	
What this script cannot do (These aren't in the HLO Export file at all):
	Perception	
	Class Key Ability
	Character appearance information (Age, height, weight, etc.)
	Any money
	I'm sure there are more I haven't found yet
	
What this script won't do (most likely ever):
	Spells - There are so many things to import just a single spell into Roll20 that it is more efficient just to use the drag-and-drop to populate your spell list. 
	NPC Sheets - I just make any unique NPCs with PC rules and then change the sheet, adding anything relevant. 
	Again, there may be more. 

Please make sure any errors or questions are submitted to https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/9630337/script-import-your-pathfinder-2e-herolab-online-character-into-roll20. That is where I will monitor the most. 

Thanks!
