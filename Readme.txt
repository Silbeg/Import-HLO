What this script does partially
Ancestry and Heritage - Some heritages do not export correctly from HLO. This does not seem to be heritage specific as I have has Twilight Halfling export on one character but not another. If your heritage is not exported, this field is filled with just your ancestry. 
Hit Points - The export contains your maximum HP, but does not break down how much comes from your ancestryand class or any bonuses like the Toughness feat. You will have to add those manually to the sheet. 

General and Skill Feats - The export contains all of your feats, but has no way to differentiate if you took it as a skill feat or a general feat. I've imported them all into general and if you want to move them, feel free. 

Ancestry Feats - One of my test character export files did not contact any Heritage feats at all. You may have to add these by drag-and-drop
